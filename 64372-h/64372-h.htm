MOHAWK CHIEF</b></p></div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the white man discovered America, he found a great, primeval wilderness of fertile valleys, high
mountains and deep forests. Tall trees had grown for centuries and their towering tops, reaching up to
the blue sky, shut out the sunlight from the gloom of the forest solitude. In the deep recesses of this wilderness
the red man, or Indian, lived in wild freedom. Skilled in woodcraft and the art of savage
warfare, he was lord and master of this vast domain, now called the United States.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/illus004b.jpg" alt="" /><p class="center"><b>TOMAHAWK</b></p></div>

<p>Although divided into numerous tribes or families, each speaking a different language,
the Indians were, in traits of character and general appearance, very much alike. In war they
were courageous, but at the same time intelligently cautious. Treacherous and deceitful to
their foes, they preferred to slay an enemy by a secret rather than an open blow. Brave and
successful a warrior as the Indian was, he excelled even more when he became a hunter. To
be victor over the beast in the chase and hunt meant to the Indian plenty to eat and stout
clothing to wear, so he developed remarkable skill in using his chief weapon, the bow and arrow.</p>



<p>Before the white man came to America the Indians were clad almost entirely in the skins
of animals which they themselves cured and dressed to perfection, fastening various pieces
together with the tendons and tough strips of skin very much as we sew to-day. These
garments, gayly ornamented with shells and colored stones, made very useful and picturesque
clothing.</p>

<p>The Indian boy was taught from early childhood to believe that his highest
attainment was to be a brave warrior and a great hunter, and to look with scorn
upon any other work. So upon the Indian women fell the task of tilling the soil.
For this reason farming never became a real industry among them and they were
amply satisfied to grow maize, or Indian corn, from which they made many
kinds of dishes and bread. A very rich and fertile soil furthered their ambitions,
for with but little attention to farming they reaped abundant crops.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/illus007.jpg" alt="" /><p class="center"><b>AN INDIAN VILLAGE</b></p></div>

<p>For houses the red men had wigwams. These they constructed by fixing long poles in the ground, tying them
together at the top, and covering them with skins of animals joined together as they sewed their clothing. They made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
an opening in the top to serve as a chimney. Such crude structures could be quickly taken down and as readily put up
again, and admirably suited the needs of their owners, who loved to wander from place to place. This peculiarity
was probably due to the fact that after living in one spot for a certain length of time they would find their natural
resources for food becoming exhausted, and perhaps an enemy had hunted out the encampment for ravage. Then, too,
it was the Indian&#8217;s nature to rove in wild natural haunts and, no doubt, a place long inhabited lost its charm for him.
A few of the tribes, however, did build permanent villages, with streets and regularly spaced wigwams, around which
they extended palisades of logs for protection against attacks from their enemies.</p>

<p>The greatest of all the Indian families, or tribes, was the Iroquois, also called the Five Nations, originally
found in what is now western and central New York State. Of the many strange legends and stories common among
the Indians, one of the most beautiful is the story of Hiawatha, which is the tale of the origin of the Iroquois.</p>

<p>Tradition tells us that Owayneo, as Indians call their Creator, made the five nations from five handfuls of
seed. One day he assembled his children together and said: &#8220;You have sprung from five different kinds of seed and
are therefore five individual nations, but you are brothers and I am your father because I made you all.&#8221; The
Mohawks, he made bold and valiant and gave them corn for their
principal food. The Oneidas, he made patient and charitable and
bade them eat freely of nuts and the fruits of the trees. The Senecas
he made industrious and active, and for their chief food gave them
the nourishing bean. To the Cayugas he gave green nuts and
instructed them to grind them, and also every kind of fruit, for
they were destined to be strong, friendly and generous. Squashes,
grapes and tobacco were his gift to the Onondagas, for they were
to be a nation wise, just and eloquent. To all in common Owayneo
gave the beasts, birds and fishes to eat and the life-giving water to
drink. &#8220;Now,&#8221; said he, &#8220;be just to all men, and kind to strangers
that come among you.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/illus008b.jpg" alt="" /><p class="center"><b>WAR-CLUB AND HATCHET</b></p></div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOLLOWING the advice of Owayneo, the Indians received the white explorers and settlers with great
kindness and hospitality. But the white men were cruel and crafty and took advantage of the friendly
red men because they wanted the Indian land and schemed by dishonest methods
to obtain possession of large tracts. Soon the Indian saw his hunting grounds
taken and his wigwam threatened with destruction. This injustice roused his
warlike and cruel nature, and relations between the white man and the red man
developed into a ceaseless warfare that penetrated into every section of the great
continent. The former peace of the wilderness was then marred by one long
succession of fierce fights and terrible massacres.</p>

<p>Indian warfare was always one of surprises, and ambuscades and fighting in a
land of forest and thicket made such a method possible. For centuries the Indian
youth had been taught this strange mode of attack. Trained
by tests of endurance and of skill, and by knowledge gained
from a hunter&#8217;s life of suffering, danger and fatigue, the
Indian boy grew to manhood. He longed for the time when
he, too, might strike the enemy and make a name for himself.
The chiefs of the tribe instructed him in the language of the
sky and the earth, in the smallest detail of woodcraft and in
the keenest methods of finding a trail.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/illus011a.jpg" alt="" /><p class="center"><b>THE WAR DANCE</b></p></div>

<p>The most ferocious and skilled warriors were the
Mohawks. When, in the early days of the Massachusetts
colony, they made war on the New England Indians, it is
told how these Indians, upon discovering the enemy, raised
the cry from hill to hill, &#8220;A Mohawk! A Mohawk!&#8221; and
fled without making any resistance. On the trail their keen sight and sense of hearing made them enemies much
to be feared. No forest or thicket was so dense that they could not find a way through. A broken twig or a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
disturbed leaf, a bit of clothing or strand of hair was all they needed to follow, with deadly surety, the most
difficult of trails.</p>

<p>So well could they imitate the calls of the birds and animals that many a white hunter
was lured to his death, and when they took a captive they were most unmerciful and
tortured their prisoners in many cruel ways. Burning at a stake and running the gauntlet
were among the most popular methods. To accomplish the latter, they first made their
prisoner run between two rows of women and children who, armed with sticks, stones
and clubs, were expected to hit him. Then the captive was tied to a stake and the braves
and chiefs threw knives and tomahawks, so that they came as close as possible to the victim
without inflicting wounds. After this ordeal fagots were piled around the stake and set on
fire. So in a most cruel fashion the Indians&#8217; bloodthirsty nature and their desire for
vengeance were satisfied.</p>

<p>With so many traits of savage instinct awakened, it is no wonder that the white
settlers, who were now penetrating every section of the land, had a hard time of it. While
working in the fields or doing other peaceful tasks some one in the settlement had to be
constantly on the watch for an Indian attack. Riding through the wilderness to visit a
neighbor or to buy supplies at the nearest town was extremely dangerous, for no one knew
the hour or minute when the war-whoop would sound and the tomahawk fall.</p>

</div>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/illus012.jpg" alt="" /><p class="center"><b>INDIANS TRYING TO SET<br /> FIRE TO A BLOCK-HOUSE</b></p></div>

<p class="drop-cap">EVERY ship sailing from Europe brought new colonists, and as the settlements grew and thrived on the sea coast
civilization advanced further and further into the great wilderness. The Indians became more ferocious and
warlike, and day and night the settlers were in constant fear of attack. Men built strong palisades of logs around
their homes and at each corner of the enclosure they placed block-houses,
which were simply square buildings two stories high with loopholes,
through which the defenders could fire their guns and still be hidden.</p>

<p>In the daytime the gates of these crude forts were thrown open,
and those who tilled the ground went out to their work while men
stationed on the outskirts of the fields guarded the settlement. But with
all these precautions there are many sad tales of Indian attacks accompanied
by bloodshed and cruel torture.</p>

<p>For long periods the Indians would remain silent in the deep
forests and not show themselves at all. Then peace seemed to prevail in
the land, and naturally the settlement became careless and the guards grew
less vigilant. At just such times the crafty Indians made their most
successful raids. Silently and stealthily their scouts watched the men at
work in the fields and the children playing outside of the stockade.
Warriors came from all directions out of the forest depths and
gathered around their leader. Then, when all was in readiness, the
terrible war-whoop sounded and the dusky foes fairly leaped
from behind every bush, rock and tree. A wild scene of confusion
ensued. Men rushed for their arms while women and children crowded
into the block-houses. The strong doors were closed and barred and the fierce fight began.</p>



<p>The Indians made every effort to get close enough to set fire to the buildings, and it was the supreme danger
against which the defenders had to contend. Many times the settlers were thus forced to run out into the midst
of their foes to defend themselves by a hand-to-hand encounter. If the Indians were successful in the attack a
terrible massacre followed, in which women and children were scalped and the men bound and tortured. After the
cruel scenes were over only a pile of charred and smoking embers remained of the once prosperous settlement. But
usually, because of their superior arms, the white men were victorious and the advance across the
continent went ever onward toward the Great West. Encountering many hardships and thrilling
adventures, these brave people made possible for us the happy, peaceful and bountiful land in which
we now live.</p>

EARLY SETTLERS</b></p></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>Young boys grew to a hardy manhood through trial and privation and gave their lives to
conquering the vast wilderness of the Far West.</p>

<p>One incident of border life shows the bravery and fearlessness of the backwoods boy.</p>

<p>Two brothers, one aged eleven, the other thirteen, were stolen while at play by two Mohawk
warriors. The Indians struck a trail leading into the deep forest and at nightfall were far enough
away from the settlement with their captives to rest without danger of being overtaken. After a light
supper they lay down to sleep, each holding one of the boys in his arms. The oldest boy, too excited
to feel sleepy, only pretended to go to sleep, and managed with great care to wriggle free from his sleeping
captor&#8217;s arms. He crossed over to his brother and gently released him from the embrace of the
other sleeping Indian and carefully carried him a short distance from the savages before waking him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;we must go home now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They will follow us,&#8221; replied the younger brother.</p>

<p>The older boy put his hand to his lips, not daring to utter a sound. He then placed the
only gun the Indians had with the muzzle close to the ear of one of the sleeping Mohawks. &#8220;Now,&#8221;
he whispered to his brother, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take the tomahawk, and when I give the signal you pull the trigger
of the gun.&#8221; When all was ready the brave boy lifted the hatchet and his brother pulled the trigger.
The Indian shot by the gun rolled over dead, but the other was not killed by the first blow. Nothing
daunted, the brave youth rained blow after blow on the skull of the stunned Mohawk until the
warrior lay quite still. The boys had lost their way, but after several days they finally succeeded in
getting out of the forest. As they entered their home they heard their mother moaning to herself,
&#8220;My poor boys, they must be killed.&#8221; With a great shout they ran to her
and threw themselves into her arms. It is inborn bravery such as this that conquered
the great wilderness and opened up the vast country that was called the Wild West.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">INDIANS OF THE PLAINS</h2>
</div>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/illus016.jpg" alt="" /><p class="center"><b>A CROW CHIEF<br /> OFFERING A CHALLENGE</b></p></div>

<p class="drop-cap">STEP by step the Indians were pushed out of the land that was theirs by just right. The white man made treaties
with them, but did not keep them, and on every hand the strong force of advancing civilization drove them toward
the land of the setting sun. Any attempt at resistance by the Indians was usually met by conquest and the most
relentless punishment. &#8220;There is not one white man who loves an Indian,&#8221; said
Sitting Bull, the warlike chief of the Ogollalas, &#8220;and not a true Indian but hates
a white man.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the year 1803 the government of France sold to the United States the
vast tract of land then known as the country of Louisiana. This included the
region in which now lie the states of Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas,
Minnesota, Montana, Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming,
two parts of Idaho, and Colorado and the territory of Oklahoma.</p>

<p>At the time this vast tract of land was acquired by our government
almost nothing was known of it. Few white men had ever travelled the trackless
plains or scaled the frowning ranges of mountains that barred the way
across the continent, and in its great unknown land there lived many tribes of
Indians who had never looked upon the face of a white man. The government
sent explorers to find out about the strange, new possessions, and, hard upon
their trails, followed the advancing tide of civilization. And every step of the
settlers&#8217; advance was bitterly contested by the savages, who fought with desperate
fierceness. New factors entered into this warfare with the savage tribes.
This territory, unlike the forest lands, was flat and barren and stretched thousands
of miles across the middle of the United States from the Missouri River
to California, with here and there a huge range of mountains running north
and south, guarded on either side by long lines of foot-hills. In rare instances there were stretches of forest, but
generally there was nothing but flat plains covered with a tall rough grass, and many other parts were alkali plains
so dry that they were totally unfit for human habitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>In his battles with the red foe the white man had up to this time been used to the cover of the thicket and
the forest. Now with little natural protection he was called upon to advance against some of the most crafty and
bloodthirsty of the Indians.</p>

<p>These Indians comprised several nations divided into tribes. They were a wild,
untamed race and, unlike the forest Indians, had horses which they managed with great
skill in battle and in the hunt.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/illus019.jpg" alt="" /><p class="center"><b>A BLACKFOOT CHIEF</b></p></div>

<p>A Western Indian on foot was out of his element, but the moment he laid his hand
upon his horse his face became handsome and he sped gracefully away&mdash;a different being.
No imagination can ever truly picture the beauty and wildness of the scenes in this romantic
country. In the chase and on the war-path these Indians were gorgeous pictures of
barbaric splendor and manly development.</p>

<p>First of all the tribes ranked the Crows and Blackfeet and their dress was extremely
picturesque. They were skilled hunters and fierce warriors. These two tribes were deadly
enemies and almost continued warfare was in progress between them. Often the chiefs
of different tribes were sworn enemies, and if they chanced to meet a fierce combat ensued.</p>

<p>Once a noted chief of the Blackfoot tribe met a famous chief of the Crows on the
banks of the Missouri River. They were on opposite sides of the stream, at a point where
the current was divided by a sand bar or small island. Uttering his shrill war-cry, the
Blackfoot waded into the river on his horse and the Crow answered the challenge, rushing
down the steep embankment into the swiftly flowing water. At almost the same instant the two horsemen emerged
at the opposite ends of the small island. Here they drew up their steeds and made the sign of peace. The Blackfoot
was the first to speak. &#8220;What has the Crow squaw to say?&#8221; he said. At this insult the Crow replied, singing
the praises of his race and taunting the Blackfoot warrior with all the hatred typical of the Indian for his enemy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am done,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;What has the dog of the prairie to say?&#8221; Infuriated beyond control, the
Crow set an arrow to his bow and sent it with deadly aim toward the naked bosom of his foe. Sudden and unlooked
for as was this attack the Blackfoot&#8217;s quick eye had seen the movement. He jerked the rein of his horse and made
him rear his forward legs into the air. Then leaning over the neck of his horse he returned the shot, which was a
signal for a perfect rain of arrows, many of which found their mark. The quivers of both Indians were soon empty,
and then began a fierce combat with the lance. The Crow quickly dismounted to avoid a thrust from the angry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
Blackfoot&#8217;s ready spear, and just in time it was, for with a yell of savage triumph the Blackfoot drove his lance right
through the body of his enemy&#8217;s pony. Then he quickly wheeled his horse and bore down upon the unmounted
Crow, who met him with a thrust that killed his horse. Down went the Blackfoot entangled in his own trappings.
His predicament was desperate. He deftly took his knife between his thumb and forefinger and threw it with
deadly accuracy at the advancing Crow. In a second it buried itself to the handle in his breast.</p>

<p>Mortally wounded, the Crow chief halted for a moment, then summoning all his strength, he drew the knife
from his breast and threw it at the Blackfoot crying, &#8220;A scalp of the mighty Crows shall never dry in the wigwams
of the Blackfeet.&#8221; With this parting word he threw himself into the swift moving river and was lost to view. Only
the bloody water marked the place.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">BUFFALO HUNTING</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE Indians of the Plains, bold and desperate horsemen, were great hunters. Their chief game was the
American bison or buffalo, which roamed over the wide prairies in vast herds, seemingly placed there by the
Great Spirit for the special use of the red man, who lived upon their flesh and clothed himself with their skins.</p>

<p>Mounted on small, fleet ponies, the Indians could readily kill them in great numbers. When pursuing the
herd, the Indian used to ride close in the rear while he selected just the animal he wanted. Then driving his pony
between it and the herd, he forced the buffalo off alone. In this way he avoided being crushed or trampled to death
by the madly rushing beasts.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/illus021.jpg" alt="" /><p class="center"><b>CATCHING WILD HORSES</b></p></div>

<p>When directly opposite the buffalo, the Indian, with
his bow ready drawn, would shoot his deadly arrow. Often
this was only a signal for a fierce encounter with the
wounded bull. For while the buffalo is a timid animal and
seldom makes an attack, he turns in fury when wounded.
With few exceptions, the Indian with the aid of his swift
pony would soon conquer the mighty beast.</p>

<p>Another method the Indians employed in hunting
buffalo, was to ride out and in a body surround a herd.
Dividing into two columns and riding in opposite directions,
they gradually circled around the animals at about a mile
distant. At a given signal they closed in on them, and the
unsuspecting herd, scenting the enemy, fled in the greatest
confusion. Where the buffalo aimed to cross the line, the
riders went at full speed, brandishing their weapons and
yelling fiercely. By these means they turned the herd off
towards another point, where they again, met by confusion and noise, wheeled back in an opposite direction.
The horsemen had by this time closed in at all points and soon had the buffalo circling around in a confused mass.</p>

<p>Then began the scene of slaughter, when hundreds of beasts were killed. Sometimes, a bull, infuriated by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
wounds, would break from the seething mass, and gore a hunter&#8217;s horse to death. The Indian would
then be obliged to leap to save himself, and in some cases had to jump from back to back of the wild
animals to avoid being crushed.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/illus022.jpg" alt="" /><p class="center"><b>A BUFFALO HUNTER</b></p></div>



<p>When enough animals were killed there followed a busy scene. The whole Indian
camp, men, women and children, set to work to cut up the meat. It was carried back to
camp, and what was not needed for food at once was dried in the sun for use in the winter
and when game was scarce.</p>

<p>The most valuable possession of the Indian was, without doubt, his horse. Large
bands of wild horses roved in freedom over the Plains, but they were very difficult to catch
and called for all the wonderful ingenuity of the red man.</p>

<p>Starting on a hunt for them, the Indian, equipped with his lasso, first mounted his
swiftest horse and rode out upon the prairies. As soon as he sighted a band he rode full
speed until he was right among them, then threw his lasso, deftly getting it over the neck of
one of the beasts. At this very instant he dismounted and, running as fast as he could, let
the lasso slip through his hands until the captive horse dropped from want of breath. Now
he quickly drew a hobble over the horse&#8217;s front feet. This done, he loosened the lasso to
give the horse a chance to breathe and made a noose around the lower jaw, which gave him more control over the
frightened animal. When it regained its breath the wild horse would rear and plunge in a frantic attempt for
freedom. The Indian, never letting go his firm hold on the lasso, advanced towards the horse&#8217;s nose, and getting
his hand over it could hold down the animal and prevent it from falling or rolling on its back. In this way he was
able to put his other hand over the horse&#8217;s eyes and breathe into its nostrils. After this, strange as it may seem, the
horse soon became perfectly docile, and the Indian had little to do but to remove the hobbles from its feet and ride
into camp.</p>

<p>With the buffalo for a constant source of food and the wild horses for their mounts the Indians of the Plains
proved a powerful and enduring obstacle to the invasion of the white man. Their highly developed skill in scouting
and prairie warfare enabled them to dispute every inch of their land with great success.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">INDIAN SCOUTS AND WARFARE ON THE PLAINS</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE great American prairies were the final gathering place of the Indians. What was left of the once powerful
tribe, the Mohicans, and the Delawares, of the Creeks, Choctaws, and Cherokees, all found refuge here. At
this period they dwelt in open hostility not only toward the white man, but among themselves. Wonderful and
powerful alike in the chase and on the trail, their conquest was not an
easy task.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/illus025.jpg" alt="" /><p class="center"><b>INDIANS SIGNALING</b></p></div>


<p>With the American Indian war was the one end and aim of living.
Tribesmen were brothers but rival tribesmen were natural enemies. So,
from the earliest times this rivalry between tribes kept them in almost
constant warfare, and the western tribes being the most primitive, their
fighting was very savage.</p>

<p>The possession of the eagle&#8217;s feather denoted success on the war-path
and was a prize every Indian hoped to obtain. From early childhood
the Indian boy was instructed in the arts of war and the hunt. Before
him was ever the vision of the eagle&#8217;s feather, and this symbol inspired
him to noble deeds and great bravery. In his barbarous training he
learned to keep two virtues, endurance and courage, constantly uppermost
in his mind.</p>

<p>Tradition tells of an Indian boy who was taken captive. The boy
knew that his trial would be severe, and summoned all his bravery to
prove the nobility of his tribal blood.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/illus026.jpg" alt="" /><p class="center"><b>AN INDIAN CREEPING<br /> THROUGH THE LONG GRASS</b></p></div>

<p>His captors held a grand council and decided that his fate should depend upon the amount of his courage
and endurance. If he bore well the torture they gave him he might be adopted into the tribe&mdash;a great honor&mdash;otherwise
they would kill him. First they held him barefoot upon the coals of the camp-fire until large blisters came
and these they pierced with bone needles and filled with sharp stones. They then formed a gauntlet and made the
little fellow run between the long lines of shouting savages. His agony was intense, but with all the courage and
fortitude of his tribe he had strength to reach the goal. A wild shout of approval went up from the Indians.
&#8220;Good,&#8221; cried a chief. &#8220;He will be a great warrior.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>But this was only the beginning of his trials. They now bound him to the stakes and tortured him with fire
and still the brave boy stood without a complaint or a moan. Then, not yet satisfied, they held him under the water
of a cold stream until his life was almost gone, but when they released him and he gained his breath he still was able
to stand up before them. &#8220;A warrior, a warrior,&#8221; they cried and then adopted him into their tribe. This boy
grew to be a noted chief of great power, hailed far and wide for his brave deeds.</p>




<p>Trained in such a hard school, no point of advantage escaped the Indians
in war or on the trail. They made good use of the tall grass of the prairies to
shield them, and would glide behind it like serpents toward their enemies, suddenly
and unexpectedly jumping up among them with shrill, wild war-whoops.</p>

<p>Scouts on horses found a way up and down and in and out of the most
difficult mountain passes, and watchers were ever kept on the tall cliffs that
fringed the more open and fertile valleys. White explorers and emigrants seeing
smoke rise from the watch fires at first looked for an attack in that direction.
But while they centered their interest on the thin rising cloud of smoke, scouts
in full war dress would be riding out on the opposite cliff and leisurely studying
the enemy. For hours the Indians would keep up this silent exchange of signals
and then at night under the cover of darkness make their unheralded attack.
Dusky forms would stealthily crawl on all fours up to the very edge of the
settlers&#8217; camp, then the call of a night bird would sound out in the stillness.
This would mean little to the white sentries on guard, unaccustomed as they
were to the methods of their savage foe.</p>

<p>Suddenly the beautiful quiet of night pervading the camp would be rent
with the wild piercing war-whoop. In an instant Indians would spring from
every conceivable spot and a scene of horrible confusion would ensue, and the sun next morning, rising in all the
splendor of the glorious western hills, would reveal the sad tale of savage massacre.</p>

<p>The white man coming in ever increasing numbers soon saw the wisdom of acquiring the services of white
plainsmen and scouts who had been trained by hard experience and could meet the Indian on his own ground.
This plan proved a great success, for without them the conquest of the Great West would have been an almost
impossible task.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">AN INDIAN ATTACK ON A WAGON TRAIN</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE spring of 1846 was a busy season on the western frontier. Not only were emigrants from every part of the
country preparing for the journey to California and Oregon, but a great number were making ready for Santa F&eacute;.
These adventurous people fitted out their wagon trains at St. Louis, and from there traveled up the Missouri River
by boat to a place called Independence. This was the usual starting
place, although occasionally trains went out from Fort Leavenworth.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/illus029.jpg" alt="" /><p class="center"><b>THE LEADER OF<br /> A WAGON TRAIN</b></p></div>


<p>These trains were usually made up of two or more large wagons,
several emigrants combining forces and, considering that hostile Indians
were always on the trail, this was a wise precaution. Some trains, however,
sent out by companies formed for the express purpose of carrying
goods to the Pacific Coast, consisted of as many as twenty-five wagons.</p>

<p>These wagons each could carry as much as six thousand pounds of
freight and were drawn by several yoke of oxen in charge of one driver.
Looking like large, flat-bottomed scows, the wagons were covered with
canvas stretched over hoops bent round in shape. In this way the goods
carried were protected from dampness and rain.</p>

<p>The trail to the Pacific Coast ran through what is now the State of
Kansas to the Big Blue River, then over the Big and the Little Sandy
River, coming into Nebraska close by the Big Sandy. Next, striking the
Little Blue, the trail followed it for some sixty miles until it came to the
Platte River near Fort Kearney. From here it wound in and out of the
rolling hills like a great serpent, and on across the prairies to Fort
Laramie, one of the most westerly frontier posts.</p>

<p>The country lying between this fort and the Salt Lake Valley, on
the other side of the Rocky Mountains, was inhabited only by hostile Indians, and it was here that many brave men
lost their lives.</p>

<p>Among the large number of people who pushed into the Wild West in the early days of emigration, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
resolute forester who had already penetrated the wilds of the forest-covered States was the first to venture. Toils
and hazards of former undertakings were forgotten, as these endless and unexplored regions were opened for
settlement.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/illus030.jpg" alt="" /><p class="center"><b>A PRAIRIE SCHOONER</b></p></div>

<p>The tints and hues of autumn were at their fullest when a train of wagons issued from the border hills to
pursue its way across the rolling surface of the great prairie. Creaking &#8220;prairie-schooners,&#8221; as the wagons were
sometimes called, heavy with stoves and household goods, and concealing the women and children, moved slowly
along the trail. Straggling sheep and cattle were herded in the rear, while in front rode or walked the sturdy
and fearless backwoodsmen. On every side stretched the broad plain which reached like a great sea to the far
distant Rocky Mountains. The leader, a tall, strong man, who rode ahead, had stopped and was looking with
shaded eyes toward the west. The setting sun cast a yellow glow over the heavens and earth and seemed to
suggest the very gold whose discovery in California was attracting
so many men to make this hazardous journey. The dress of this
leader was very picturesque. From his deer-skin belt hung his
hunting knife, with its buckhorn handle, and his hat of martens&#8217;
fur gave to his strong face a look of great determination. The
stock of his rifle, that was loosely hung over his shoulder, was of
beautiful mahogany riveted and bound with precious metal. In
addition to the rifle, a carefully guarded powder horn and a keen,
bright wood axe were slung across his back.</p>

<p>As evening came, a camp was sought for the night. A cool spring that burst forth from the side of a gently
sloping hill, and proved to be the source of a prairie stream, called a run, offered the desired water and fresh grass
for the cattle and horses, and was quickly chosen.</p>

<p>It was a busy scene while the camp was made, and every member of the train had his task. The great
wagons were swung into a circle to afford the best means of protection in case of attack.</p>

<p>When the evening meal was over, lots were drawn to see who should stand guard for the night. This decided,
women and children went to bed and the sheep and cattle were driven into the corral formed by the wagons.</p>

<p>Night came on and the stars shone out with the special brilliancy of the western sky. It was now the first
watch of the night and the pale light of a new moon played over the endless waves of the prairie, tipping the ridges
with gleams of light and leaving the hollows purple in darkness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus031.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>&nbsp;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>On a knoll some little distance from the camp crouched several dusky forms. Low guttural tones came from
the throats of the band of Indians, who in fierce war paint and with fiery eyes looked more like demons than men.</p>

<p>Crouching low, with a snake-like motion three of the band crawled away through the tall grass. It was some
minutes before they returned and reported what they had seen in the camp. Then, at a given signal, several more
warriors rode up upon their fleet ponies and dismounted. A council was held, but when the scouts reported that
the wagon train was strongly fortified, the Indians decided to give up the attack that night, and mounting, almost as
one man, the wild riders rode like the wind across the moonlit prairie and were soon lost in the dim distance.</p>

<p>With the first break of day the emigrant train was in motion and once more began its weary journey. All
went well until, a few hours after sunrise, the leader suddenly came to a halt. On a rise of ground some distance ahead
appeared a bright spot, which, upon closer observation, proved to be a mounted Indian. The alarm was soon given,
and the whole train at once became the scene of hurried and exciting preparation. The wagons were quickly
wheeled into a circle and the women, children and stock were cared for just as they had been the night before.
There was not a moment to lose. For at all points Indians now appeared mounted and in full war dress. They
were riding like mad, circling the group of wagons at some distance. Finally a great piercing war-cry sounded and
the wild and furious riders closed in on the settlers. Coming within range of the backwoodsmen&#8217;s rifles, the red
foes threw themselves on the off side of their horses, and so placed the animals between them and the accurate aim
of the long rifles of the train defenders.</p>

<p>While this excitement was going on the emigrants did not see the dark forms crawling through the long grass
toward their fort. Suddenly a terrible yell of savage success rent the air and an awful scene of bloodshed and hand-to-hand
encounter followed. In the confusion the animals broke loose and stampeded, and away they went across
the plains, the Indian riders in wild pursuit to capture their booty.</p>

<p>The enemy gone, it was a desolate scene that greeted the emigrant leader. Many of his best men were dead,
most of his cattle gone, and scarcely enough horses left for half his wagons. But he was indeed fortunate, since
none of the women and children had been killed or taken captive.</p>

<p>In spite of such odds as these the Great West grew and settlements multiplied. This was due to the courage
and indomitable will of these first comers, who in spite of almost insurmountable difficulties did not lose heart or
ambition.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE PONY EXPRESS</h2>
</div>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/illus034.jpg" alt="" /><p class="center"><b>INDIANS LYING IN WAIT<br /> FOR THE &#8220;PONY EXPRESS&#8221;</b></p></div>

<p class="drop-cap">TWO thousand miles of waste land lay between the western frontier and California and the long wagon trains
sent out by the various companies did very well for carrying freight. But as the settlements grew in number
there came a demand for a speedier method of communication by which letters and money might be sent to the
Pacific Coast and other points. The long journey of the slowly moving wagons
did not interfere very much in matters of freight, but the settlers soon realized
that business arrangements and papers needed better and quicker means of
transportation.</p>



<p>The great freight transporters, therefore, conceived the idea of a scheme
for carrying letters at a much faster rate to San Francisco by means of a single
horseman riding a pony at full speed. Their idea was that a man should mount
a swift pony, capable of great endurance, and ride straight out into the open
desert, where, at the end of fifteen miles, there would be a station with several
men in it, who would have ready another fresh pony. This horseman was to
slow up at this shanty, jump to the ground with his bag of letters, immediately
jump on the fresh pony and ride fast and furiously for another fifteen miles to
the next similar station. It happened that some of these stations were in towns
and settlements, but more often they were on the bleak prairies or in the hills of
the Rocky Mountains. This pony express followed the same trail as that used
by the wagon trains, but since the wagon train stations were usually forty-five
miles apart of course many more stations had to be built. A man who rode
one of these divisions rode fifteen miles on one pony, fifteen miles on the
second, and fifteen miles on the third. Then he began his return trip of
forty-five miles.</p>

<p>Sometimes it would be easy riding over open country, then again it might be up rocky gulches or through
forests difficult to traverse. Men of the hardest sort of physique and endurance were required, and the ponies
had to be sure-footed and swift. The wages paid for this work were liberal, so the companies owning the route
were able to procure the best men on the frontier.</p>

<p>Over the saddle hung mail pouches that weighed about twenty pounds. This was really a very small part of
the amount of mail to be sent, but the ponies could not carry a heavier load, so to increase the number of letters
and lessen the weight, people later wrote on tissue paper. Paper money was carried because gold and silver were
too heavy and bulky. One of the enterprising eastern newspapers printed a special edition of their news on tissue
paper for transportation only on this famous pony express.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus035.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>It was an exciting time when the fast mail left St. Joseph, the starting place. At the moment of leaving a
frontiersman came hurriedly out of the post-office, threw the mail bags over the saddle, leaped on the pony and
started off at full speed, leaving a curious crowd to gaze wonderingly after his dusty trail. The average distance
covered in a day by this queer express was two hundred miles, a speed of about eight miles an hour.</p>

<p>It took great endurance for these men to be in the saddle for seventy or more miles a day. But, endurance
was not the only quality the rider needed. Over the whole route there was constant danger of being held up, either
by Indians or by outlaws, who were eager to get the money that was often carried. So the rider had to be a
courageous and skilled frontiersman who had keen knowledge of Indian warfare.</p>

<p>Often reports would come to the stations that Indians were in the vicinity. The express rider departing was
advised to keep a sharp eye on the trail. Behind a pile of rocks a bright spot might show which, to the trained
vision of the frontiersman, immediately meant possible danger. The little speck of color was perhaps the feather
of an Indian&#8217;s head dress. There was no chance or time to turn, the rider kept on at his furious pace until he
was within shot. A puff of smoke suddenly came from behind the rock and out would jump the Indian warriors.
But quick as a bullet speeds the express rider would be quicker, and ducking behind his pony turned him instantly
off the trail and thus avoided being shot then and there. Now, however, came a ride for life, for just ahead more
Indians would appear and try to block the way. Luckily few of the Indians had guns in these days and the
frontiersman, watching his chance, could usually kill one or two Indians before they succeeded in shooting their
arrows. This would act as a sudden check to the red men, and fast and furious the express rider would spur
his pony on toward the station and escape.</p>

<p>Once in a great while, however, because of the many hostile Indians who laid in wait all along the trails to
capture the riders, the pony express had to be stopped for a time.</p>

<p>The next step in western travel was the famous overland stage which ran from St. Joseph to Sacramento, a
distance of one thousand miles. This was a most difficult enterprise. For the stage carried at times large sums of
money and was therefore frequently held up by highwaymen or Indians.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>The coaches were strange, heavy vehicles with very large wheels, made unusually strong, since they traveled
the roughest roads imaginable. Passengers could ride either inside or out, but no one ever thought of going
without being fully armed, for day or night the coach was likely to be attacked.</p>

<p>One of the most famous trips was made by Buffalo Bill from Fort Kearney to Plum Creek. It was a
difficult task to manage six horses and at the same time keep a keen eye open for Indians. Owing to Buffalo
Bill&#8217;s skill the stage usually got through, but in the hands of other less competent drivers the tale was often a
sad one, with heavy loss of money and good men killed or wounded.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE GOVERNMENT&#8217;S FIGHT AGAINST THE INDIANS</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ALTHOUGH the United States Government had maintained frontier forts, it was forced finally to undertake
important aggressive campaigns against the Indians. The white settlements encroached more and more on
the Indian territory, and the red man seeing nothing ahead but the destruction of his cherished hunting grounds by
these intruders, aimed to destroy every white man he saw, but inch by inch the savages were crowded back from the
land that was rightfully theirs into a cramped and limited area.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/illus039.jpg" alt="" /><p class="center"><b>SITTING BULL</b></p></div>


<p>The Indian knew no law but that of simple justice, and in his dealings he had always
wanted to be honest. On every hand, however, he now met cruelty, dishonesty and broken
faith, and he learned to think of the white man as a terrible crushing power fit only to be
done away with, and this finally became the keynote of his existence.</p>

<p>In 1862 there was an outbreak of the powerful Sioux tribes due directly to the failure
of our government to keep its pledges to the Indians, who were depending upon the promised
money due them in payment for their land. They were aroused to a sense of this injustice
by an actual want of the necessities of life, for robbed of his hunting and fishing ground, the
Indian knew no way to get a living. Some say that he should have tilled the soil like the
white man, but it must not be forgotten that having lived for centuries in a savage state, he
was not fitted to meet the demands of civilization.</p>

<p>The great Civil War was raging and draining the country of its fighting men.
Knowing only one way to right their wrongs, the Indians seized this unique opportunity and
on the morning of August 18th, 1862, a party of one hundred and fifty Sioux, under Chief Little Crow, began a
massacre of the white settlers on both sides of the Minnesota River.</p>

<p>For three weeks the Indians had their own way, meeting with no strong resistance, most of the men then serving
in the Union Army. Finally the government assembled a force large enough to resist the savages successfully and
put down the uprising. But this was only temporary peace, for the Indians were very persistent. One Indian war
after another was fought until the government forces became strong enough to maintain obedience from
the red man.</p>

<p>One of the most disastrous of the battles in the West was that which took place after General Sheridan ordered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
the Sioux and Northern Cheyenne tribes to give up their hunting grounds, and to go upon a reservation. This did
not please the Indians. They stood firmly for their rights and another Sioux war resulted.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/illus040.jpg" alt="" /><p class="center"><b>A U.S. TROOPER ON THE TRAIL</b></p></div>

<p>Three columns of troops under Generals Crook, Terry and Custer were sent out in May, 1876. But after a
fierce but indecisive fight between Crook and the Sioux, the soldiers fell back to Tongue River.</p>

<p>Sitting Bull was the Indian leader at this time, and his warriors were stationed between the head waters of the
Rosebud and the Big Horn rivers. Into this section Custer and
his gallant troops marched.</p>

<p>With Sitting Bull was another noted chief, Crazy Horse, and
both were very hostile to the whites. Other discontented tribes
drifted to their camps and swelled the force to a very large number.
They occupied a position of great advantage near the head
of the Yellowstone, surrounded by the &#8220;bad lands,&#8221; a tract most
difficult to travel because there was but little water for the troops
and horses. Besides the Indians were well located at about an
equal distance from the Indian agencies, from which they were
annually supplied by the government with the best of arms and
ammunition according to treaty agreements.</p>

<p>Sitting Bull was a heavily built Indian with an extremely
large and handsome head, and unlike most Indians, his hair was
brown. He had a forceful mind, with a genius for war, and was
extremely heroic. The order requiring him to go on the reservation
was in violation of a treaty made between his tribe and the United
States authorities, and the attempt to force it was a national
disgrace, proving how unfairly we treated the Indian. Soon after the battles with General Crook, Sitting Bull said
to General Miles, who commanded the western troops, &#8220;I want peace, but if the troops come out I will fight them.
I want to hunt buffalo and to trade. I don&#8217;t want rations and money. I want to live like an Indian.&#8221;</p>

<p>In accordance with government orders, General Custer set out on the twenty-third of June with the Seventh
Cavalry, to follow the Indian trail up the Rosebud River. After three days they found themselves in the valley of
the Little Big Horn River, close to the hostile tribes. The command was divided into three detachments&mdash;one led
by Custer, one by Major Reno, and a third by Captain Benteen. In attacking the Indian village it was planned that
Reno was to take the upper section, Custer the lower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus041.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>&nbsp;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>Major Reno&#8217;s attack was not strongly made and he was easily driven back, as was also Captain Benteen, so
that these two detachments failed to support Custer. So it happened that with only five companies this brave general
was compelled to encounter the entire Indian force. &#8220;Do not let an Indian escape,&#8221; were his orders, and he threw
himself upon them, believing that with the help of the other commands he could inflict a severe punishment upon
the red foe.</p>

<p>And now comes a sad story. It seemed as though the Great Spirit was for once with his own people. Custer
surprised the Indians at the river front, but they quickly rallied and drove the troops back up the hill. Hundreds of
Indians poured into the river on ponies and on foot and attacked the small force in front of them. They made a
circuit around the hill and slowly but surely closed in on the valiant troops. A final stand was made at the lower
end of the hill in a bloody fight that lasted from two o&#8217;clock until sunset. Not one man of the five companies, not
even the brave general, was left alive.</p>

<p>From this time on the government persistently fought the red man, finally conquering his spirit and gaining
complete possession of his lands.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE COWBOYS</h2>
</div>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/illus044.jpg" alt="" /><p class="center"><b>A PLAINSMAN AND<br /> CATTLE RANGER<br />
OF EARLY DAYS</b></p></div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT did not take long for men to learn that the great western country was a valuable grazing land. The section of the
West which includes New Mexico, part of Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and the western part of Texas,
Nebraska, Kansas and Dakota, became a great cattle range. There were neither fences nor boundaries on this gigantic
unbroken pasture, and here there grew up and flourished a great cattle raising industry.</p>

<p>A traveller seeing this land for the first time would wonder how such a parched
and desolate country could give maintenance to cattle at all. Lying as it does in the arid
belt, it is a region of but light rainfall; the grass is short and scanty; there are no trees
except along the beds of streams, and in many places there are alkali deserts where
nothing grows but sage-brush and cactus. In other parts the land stretches out into level
plains that seem almost endless, or into beautiful rolling prairies. The muddy rivers,
running through in broad shallow beds, after a rain become swollen torrents, while in
droughts even the larger streams dwindle into mere sluggish trickles of water, and the
smaller ones dry up entirely, except for occasional pools. Perhaps this land might have
lain idle for years had not the hardy plainsman been keen to observe that great herds of
buffalo lived and thrived on the short brown grass peculiar to the region.</p>

<p>As the cattle raising industry progressed in Texas there naturally grew up a race
of strong, fearless men called cowboys, because of their occupation dealing with cattle. No
prouder soul than the cowboy ever lived. He was proud of his prowess as a horseman and
had little use for any one not skilled in the saddle. Loving and dependent companions, his horse and he were inseparable.</p>

<p>The cowboys of the old Wild West were wonderful riders and born fighters, two necessary virtues these, for
almost constantly many disputes had to be settled on the ranches with rival cattle men or with Indians.</p>

<p>The lasso or rope is the one essential feature of every cowboy&#8217;s equipment. Loosely coiled, it hangs from
the horn, or is tied to one side of the saddle, and is used for many emergencies. In helping to pull a cow out of a
bog hole, or a wagon up a steep hill it is invaluable. Every cowboy aspires to be a good roper so that he can handle
the lasso with ease, swiftness and precision. A first-class roper can demand his own price, for he is eagerly sought
after by the cattle men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus045.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/illus047.jpg" alt="" /><p class="center"><b>A COWBOY</b></p></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>When it comes to riding a horse, the cowboy is unsurpassed and there is nothing that is possible at all that
he cannot do in the saddle. The &#8220;broncho busters&#8221; or horse breakers, perform really marvelous feats, riding with
ease the most vicious wild horses unused to the hand of man. Such a rider cannot be jarred out of the saddle by the
most desperate and sudden plunges of the bucking horse. Their method of breaking a horse is very rough. They
simply saddle and bridle a beast by main force, and ride him until he is completely exhausted and submissive. At
this point the horse is considered broken and his owner may later train him to stop or wheel instantly at a touch of
the reins, or to start at top speed at a sudden signal.</p>

<p>But while the cowboy&#8217;s horse may do all these things for him, it would be impossible
for any but an expert rider, even to approach such vicious horses. A man who is merely
an ordinary rider would probably lose his life.</p>

<p>The cowboy&#8217;s life was full of continual excitement and hard work when out on the
cattle range. While he was riding alone on the Plains, a band of Indians would often suddenly
appear and, forming in a circle, ride madly around him. There was then nothing to do but
stand them off until help came, or if forced, put up as good a fight single handed as possible
while ammunition lasted. If the cowboy was an experienced frontiersman and did not
lose his nerve, he could successfully cope with a small band of Indians, because he could
match a gun against the Indians&#8217; arrows.</p>

<p>All these romantic and adventurous times finally gave way to the ever advancing
civilization. The extensive tracts, then natural and free, were gradually cut up into small
ranches enclosed by barbed wire fences. The cowboy too had to bear the marks of civilization
and acknowledge the reign of law, but he still rides to-day as skillfully and easily as
ever, sitting erect and jaunty, reins held high and loose in his hands, his whole body free
yet firm in the saddle with the seat of the perfect horseman. His broad brimmed hat
still sweeps up and back in the same careless freedom of those lawless days, and his belt is
still adorned with the deadly guardians of his safety, his spurs jingling as he rides. His
pony is the same as those of many years ago and trots steadily forward with the easy
movement characteristic only of the western horse.</p>

<p>The cowboy as he rides on, erect and strong, true to the life of freedom he loves, waves his hat in adieu
and the sun sets behind the blue hills of what was once the Great Wild West.</p>

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
